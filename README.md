# 2018-MetamaterialMechanismsOptimization

### ShearCell_Optimization (C++)
Simulation in C++, based on IPOPT (windows binary and build file is included)

### ShearCell_Interaction (C#)
Contains 
- GUI
- Simulated annealing.
- All data management of the cell grid
- Routines to create data sets (currently exported as images)

I believe ShearCell_Editor is not used, was supposed to be the 3D version.
